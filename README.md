# Cannot load QRC HTML file in QWebEngineView on Ubuntu 20.04 only


A MCVE for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67692525/cannot-load-qrc-html-file-in-qwebengineview-on-ubuntu-20-04-only

## Using the example

Tested with Qt 5.15.0. You need Qt WebEngine (not available in Qt 6 prior to 6.2)

In mainwindow.cpp You will find two boolean variables you can tweak to illustrate the problem:
* `loadFromQrc`: 
    * if true, it calls `m_view->load(QUrl("qrc:/library/<filename>.html")`.
        * There is one additional variable in this case: `loadFromCDN` which determines whether it loads `library/geometry_preview.html` or `library/geometry_preview_cdn.html`
        * The difference between these two is that in one case, the content of the three.min.js revision r71 [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/r71/build/three.min.js) is pasted in place (**it fails to load**), in the other it loads it from the cloudflare CDN (**it succeeds**)
    * If not, it loads the content of `library/geometry_preview.html` into a QString and calls `m_view->setHtml`: **it works**
